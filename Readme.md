For an app where customers can order farm products uploaded by farmers, you’ll need a structured workflow and solid verification and validation processes to ensure quality and compliance. Here’s a breakdown of the verification processes and a full workflow for your app.

---

### 1. Full Workflow of the App


#### **Step 1: Farmer Registration and Verification**

   - Farmers create an account and upload verification documents (e.g., business license, farm registration).
   - The admin reviews and approves farmer profiles. Only verified farmers can list products.

#### **Step 2: Product Upload by Farmer**

   - Farmers log in and access their dashboard to list new products, including details such as product name, description, price, quantity, and harvest date.
   - Farmers upload images of the product, which undergo automatic quality validation (e.g., image resolution, clarity).
   - The farmer confirms that all data is correct and submits the product for admin approval.

#### **Step 3: Admin Verification of Product**

   - The admin receives a notification for new products pending review.
   - The admin checks the product's details, images, and compliance with set guidelines (e.g., quality, origin).
   - If the product passes, the admin approves it, and it’s made visible to buyers. If not, feedback is sent to the farmer to make adjustments.

#### **Step 4: Product Display on Customer Dashboard**

   - Approved products appear in the marketplace for customers to browse, filter, and search.
   - Customers view product details, including images, price, farmer ratings, and origin.

#### **Step 5: Customer Order Placement**

   - Customers add products to their cart, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout.
   - They can review their order details, choose a payment method, and confirm their order.

#### **Step 6: Farmer Receives Order Notification**

   - Once a customer places an order, the farmer receives a notification on their dashboard.
   - The farmer prepares the product for delivery, confirming product quality and quantity before dispatch.

#### **Step 7: Admin Monitors Order Fulfillment**

   - The admin has an order management dashboard to oversee the delivery status and handle issues if they arise.
   - This helps ensure that farmers fulfill their orders on time and maintain quality standards.

#### **Step 8: Product Delivery and Customer Feedback**

   - Customers receive their orders and can provide feedback, which the system tracks.
   - Negative feedback or low ratings can automatically trigger a review of the farmer’s products by the admin.
